                <p class="accelerate-ai__content">Generative AI unlocks new frontiers for enterprises and scale-ups. The
                    GenAI workshop by Neurons Lab and AWS is designed to identify and evaluate generative AI use cases, as
                    well as build prototypes.
                    Participants will leave with a clear roadmap for selecting and tuning LLMs, determining whether to train
                    new models or use pre-existing ones, and a list of hosting options, such as Amazon SageMaker and Amazon
                    Bedrock. We will build a working PoC to validate assumptions and reduce risk in future investments in
                    GenAI technology.</p>
